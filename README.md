# obd2-cpp
A work in progress CPP library for interfacing with the OBD2 port of modern vehicles. Uses Linux SocketCAN for ISO-TP communication over the vehicles CAN-Bus.

## Plans for this project
- Split into seperate UDS and OBD2 libraries to be fully standard compliant
- Allow other backends than SocketCAN to allow usage on embedded devices without Linux

**Documentation to be done**
